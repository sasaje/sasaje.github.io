## About
My name is Sara and I'm a student at _Computer Science_.
I'm looking forward to get started with **programming**. 

Previously I have been programming in:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. jQuery 
5. An a bit of PHP.


**## What have I learned so far?**

I learned how to write som Java code in IntelliJ. 
This is actually my first Java program:

````
public class Hello {
    // psvm - public static void main(String[] args){}
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // sout - System.out.println("text");        
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
        
    }
    
}
````

I also learned about GitHub
